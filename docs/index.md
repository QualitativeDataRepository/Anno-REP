# A Tool to Restructure, Edit, and Package Annotations (Anno-REP)
We are building an open-source, web-based tool, Anno-REP, that will help facilitation [Annotation for Transprent Inquiry (ATI)](https:/qdr.syr.edu/ati) and other annotation-based workflows.. 

By helping authors to overcome most practical dilemmas related to using ATI, Anno-REP will maximize ATI’s efficiency and effectiveness. Specifically, from an author’s standpoint, Anno-REP will:  
Allow the creation, preview, and editing of annotations in a native authoring environment;
Facilitate the restructuring of annotations and their linking (together with underlying data sources) to relevant text passages;
Ease the editing of web-based annotations;
Expedite the packaging and submission of annotations and underlying data sources (i.e., an “ATI data supplement”) to publishers and repositories

A simple schematic of the tool from an author’s perspective is depicted below.  

Anno-REP empowers authors to create and curate their own web-based annotations at any point in the writing process; signal the motivation for those annotations; enhance their interpretability; and publish those annotations on a web page in tandem with the scholarly work that they accompany. As such, Anno-REP will facilitate ATI’s seamless integration into writing and publishing processes. This will empower more authors to more easily generate and share annotations, significantly increasing the openness, comprehensibility and evaluability of their qualitative and multi-method research. Anno-REP’s development also augments ATI’s intellectual impact, both minimizing disruption to, and actively supporting, the writing process. Authors who use Anno-REP can still employ their preferred text editing software. Moreover, creating and labeling annotations while writing can enhance the creative process, just as linking in and documenting underlying data while writing may help authors to replace ad-hoc practices.

From a technical standpoint, the specific functions that Anno-REP will carry out include: 
- Extract annotations from a manuscript that was written using a text editor (e.g., in Word, LibreOffice, LaTeX, etc.);
- Create a persistent link between each annotation and the passage in the manuscript with which it is associated; 
- Create links from each annotation to any underlying data files that may accompany it; 
- Allow the  removal, addition, and editing of restructured annotations;
- Assign a label describing the motivation or reason for creating an annotation (e.g., to underpin descriptive or causal inference, to discuss data generation, etc.);
- Package annotations, text anchors, and underlying data into one archivable file (e.g., a zip file);
- Provide push-button submission of that package to a data repository or publisher, which can make the material visible at any dedicated URL (e.g., on the review version of the manuscript or the journal web page for the article).
