The fuzzy trace theory predicts that it may be completely unrealistic to even expect patients to recall accurate risk information. While clinicians typically report risk information as percentages or relative risks, the evidence suggests that people may code information qualitatively. Decision making has been shown to be subject to bias as a result of heuristics. More recent evidence indicates that much of the information that people are presented with may not even be used in the decision making process.”\n\n**Analytic note:** The cited article provides are review of other research that has found patient understanding of risk to be limited, particularly for those patients who face substantial treatment risks. \n\n**Full Citation:** Lloyd AJ.

Clarifying patients' objectives is not a substitute for the GMC's guidance on good consent practice. Rather, it provides the ideal reference point for tailoring treatment and information to individual patients' needs. Conversely, if patients' objectives are not established, offers of treatment with even full disclosure of risks, benefits, and alternatives, may yet fail to be patient centred if made in ignorance of what a compliant patient truly wants.”\n\n**Analytic Note:** The cited article supports the empirical claim that patient-centred care is considered important in the UK. It discusses the need to ensure that consent is patient-centred and highlights the importance of doing this to comply with relevant UK guidelines. \n\n**Full Citation:** Bridson J.

So, I, I, I think that, explaining that to the adult population, they would understand, particularly with knowing the benefits for children [yeah], that this is reasonable if it’s done in a controlled way; that we’re selective about which organs are split [yeah], and that we reduce the, er, time taken to get the liver to the centre, which is one of the issues [yeah] at the moment, about where it’s split.

Because I have grandchildren and if it were me and it was a choice between me having a transplant and them, it would be them. Everyday. I think children are the priority. Definitely. \n\nI:\tYeah and would you feel that if it was just your grandchildren or if it was any child?\n\nIV:\tAny one, any child. Any child. I think where it's difficult, I mean I'm 60 when I had my transplant. And I knew there was a chance I was going to die. But I felt that at 60 well at least I'd had 60 good years of life. And for me, if it meant a split liver and it not working well, so be it, a child's life might well have been saved. To me that’s a priority. And that wouldn't just be my children or my grandchildren, it would be anybody's. Yes. Definitely. \n\nI:\tSo you generally think it's okay for children to receive priority. \n\nIV:\tI do, I absolutely do, yes. \n\nI:\tAnd you'd have been happy to take the split liver if it meant that a child could also receive a transplant? \n\nIV:\tAbsolutely, yes. I mean I feel that children on the waiting list should be the priority anyway. That’s always been my feeling. Where I think I may - I start to worry is it's okay for me to say that I'm 60, plus, and there are people much younger than me on the waiting list, but they're not children. And maybe it's more significant for them to have a whole liver and not a split one.

So splitting livers is something that can be done to turn one very good liver into two livers basically. And normally that’s done so that one adult can receive a transplant and one child can also receive a transplant, erm so in some ways it creates two livers from one liver. [yeah] Erm but unfortunately for the adult recipient they tend to not do quite as well as if they had been given a whole liver. Erm were you aware of that?\n\nIV:\tYeah. I was aware of that. \n\nI:\tYeah so would you have been willing to accept a split liver [yeah] if they had offered you one? \n\nIV:\tDefinitely, yeah. \n\nI:\tAnd that’s even considering the additional risks involved? [yeah] Okay and erm - so why would that be? \n\nIV:\tErm because I think it's - I'm 55 now, I was 53, and erm children, they haven't lived have they? [no] And I would much rather a child's life was saved [yeah] I mean I've got seven grandchildren, [yeah] and if push come to shove I'd rather children be saved. \n\nI:\tYeah so I mean to what extent would you think that children's lives should almost take priority over adult's lives?

But there may be some disservice to the adults [yeah], because of the slightly inferior right lobe graft that you get [yeah] as opposed to a whole donor, but I think in essence it is the, sort of, right thing to be doing [yeah], because the paediatric waiting list benefits from this. \n\nI:\tYeah. Do you think that simply because it’s benefiting children, or would you think the same if it was, erm, benefiting other adults, as well?\n\nIV:\tThere are different ways to split livers and you can split a liver in such a way that you could give half of the liver to each adult [yeah], small adults, but the liver would have to be split slightly differently, and there’s a degree of expertise that’s needed for that [yeah]. Erm, again, I think that, in this era of organ shortage, anything that could be done to maximise reasonable quality organs [yeah] is of benefit.\n\n**Analytic note:** This extended quotation illustrates the qualification articulated by many members of transplant that it is important to maximise reasonable quality organs.

[yeah] I think you have to see [yeah] some degree of understanding from the patient or some statement to say well, doctor, I don’t mind, I trust you or something along those lines [yeah] to be valid when they sign the consent form. \n\n**Analytic note:** This quotation was used to support the descriptive claim that some members of staff felt that there are limits to what staff can achieve in terms of enhancing patient understanding, but that they should do their best. \n\n**Full Citation:** Moorlock et al., interview with LS2 (LS= Liver staff).","created":"2018-01-29T19:11:20.510583+00:00","uri":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-quarterly-of-healthcare-ethics/article/an-empirically-informed-analysis-of-the-ethical-issues-surrounding-split-liver-transplantation-in-the-united-kingdom/5642AEED588AE562B8D72A94A7163F34/core-reader","flagged":false,"user_info":{"display_name":"Qualitative Data Repository"},"user":"acct:QDR@hypothes.is","hidden":false,"document":{"title":["An Empirically Informed Analysis of the Ethical Issues Surrounding Split Liver Transplantation in the United Kingdom"]},"id":"MLXxNAUoEeiZV2PwYWwJ7Q","permissions":{"read":["group:__world__"],"admin":["acct:QDR@hypothes.is"],"update":["acct:QDR@hypothes.is"],"delete":["acct:QDR@hypothes.is"]}},{"updated":"2018-04-18T15:22:26.360013+00:00","group":"zvEVDE2R","target":[{"source":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-quarterly-of-healthcare-ethics/article/an-empirically-informed-analysis-of-the-ethical-issues-surrounding-split-liver-transplantation-in-the-united-kingdom/5642AEED588AE562B8D72A94A7163F34/core-reader","selector":[{"conformsTo":"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3236","type":"FragmentSelector","value":"sec3-1"},{"endContainer":"/section[5]/div[1]/div[1]/div[3]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[3]/div[2]/p[1]","startContainer":"/section[5]/div[1]/div[1]/div[3]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[3]/div[2]/p[1]","type":"RangeSelector","startOffset":350,"endOffset":532},{"type":"TextPositionSelector","end":37905,"start":37723},{"exact":"Some staff were concerned that giving patients more information might cause undue worry or result in patients making decisions that might be contrary to their best medical interests:","prefix":"ients to understand everything.

[Yeah] What is consent? I’m asking you a question.\n\nI:\tWell, I guess it’s, generally speaking, erm, granting permission to go ahead with something, but informed consent will be saying that you understand the risks and the potential benefits associated with it.\n\nIV:\tYeah, but, er, informed consent is a myth [yeah] in most cases...\n\nI:\tRight, okay.\n\nIV:\t...erm, and we will go some way towards trying to, er, ensure that they have informed consent, the patient, but a lot of them don’t read it or take it in [right]. And we certainly don’t give them proper informed consent, every minute detail [no], the figures and everything [yeah], because that would almost certainly result in people not doing operations which you know are actually very safe and that, actually, their overall general health would be less good [yeah] because they wouldn’t have had the treatment that they, that would have given them great benefit [yeah]. So I think informed consent is an extremely difficult [yeah] concept, and is, it’s something that’s easily trotted out [yeah], as, oh, you know, ‘We really must have informed consent,’ but what it actually means in practice is a very different thing.\n\n**Analytic note:** This quotation, in full, provides evidence for the descriptive claim that some staff had concerns about the implications of providing too much information. It highlights how a member of staff considered giving too much information to potentially be contrary to the best interests of their patients. The quotation arose in a discussion relating to informed consent, and I interpreted this data as expressing doubts about the informedness of consent, but also the value of informed consent. This participant appeared to have little confidence in patients making ‘good’ decisions on the basis of complex information. \n\n**Full Citation:** Moorlock et al., interview with LS17 (LS= Liver staff).\n","created":"2018-01-29T19:05:56.799273+00:00","uri":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-quarterly-of-healthcare-ethics/article/an-empirically-informed-analysis-of-the-ethical-issues-surrounding-split-liver-transplantation-in-the-united-kingdom/5642AEED588AE562B8D72A94A7163F34/core-reader","flagged":false,"user_info":{"display_name":"Qualitative Data Repository"},"user":"acct:QDR@hypothes.is","hidden":false,"document":{"title":["An Empirically Informed Analysis of the Ethical Issues Surrounding Split Liver Transplantation in the United Kingdom"]},"id":"b6Q-9gUnEeiSEcuPWLgTWw","permissions":{"read":["group:__world__"],"admin":["acct:QDR@hypothes.is"],"update":["acct:QDR@hypothes.is"],"delete":["acct:QDR@hypothes.is"]}},{"updated":"2018-04-18T15:21:15.281410+00:00","group":"zvEVDE2R","target":[{"source":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-quarterly-of-healthcare-ethics/article/an-empirically-informed-analysis-of-the-ethical-issues-surrounding-split-liver-transplantation-in-the-united-kingdom/5642AEED588AE562B8D72A94A7163F34/core-reader","selector":[{"conformsTo":"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3236","type":"FragmentSelector","value":"sec1"},{"endContainer":"/section[5]/div[1]/div[1]/div[3]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/p[2]","startContainer":"/section[5]/div[1]/div[1]/div[3]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/p[2]","type":"RangeSelector","startOffset":370,"endOffset":464},{"type":"TextPositionSelector","end":30777,"start":30683},{"exact":"Splitting livers has reduced waiting times and subsequent waiting list mortality for children,","prefix":"dult and a smaller-sized adult.

Since implementation of a policy to split every suitable liver, we have decreased the waiting list for children younger than 1 year from 128 days to 24 days; for children older than 1 year, the waiting time has decreased from 192 days to 30 days. Further, use of split livers will benefit the small blood group 0 recipient, the perennial laggard on the transplant waiting list.”\n\n**Analytic note:** This source uses statistics from the United States rather than the UK, but it is broadly acknowledged that liver splitting has had the same impact in the UK.\n\n**Full Citation:** Busuttil R, Goss JA.
